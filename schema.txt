What is schema in php?
-----------------------------
Schema is the structure of a database system, described in a formal 
language supported by the DBMS (Database management system). 
In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, 
the fields in each table, and the relationships between fields and tables. 
Schemas are generally stored in a data dictionary.
